# Simple Calculator
### Here are some cool features I've added:
#### 1️⃣ **Four Operations**: My calculator handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
#### 2️⃣ Handles negative numbers and results.
#### 3️⃣ **Endless Operations**: It can tackle as many operations as you need.
#### 4️⃣ **Countless Operands**: From two to many operands, it's got you covered.
#### 5️⃣ **Infinite Digits**: No need to worry about digits – it's ready for any number.
#### 6️⃣ **Zero Division Error**: It's designed to catch math errors, like dividing by zero.

### This project was crafted using a layered model approach, dividing the functionality into layers - HAL (LCD and Keypad), MCAL (GPIO).
### With static configuration, I developed all drivers (LCD, keypad, GPIO) and created header files from scratch.
