# Simple Calculator
### Here are some cool features I've added:
#### 1️⃣ Four Operations: My calculator handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
#### 2️⃣ Endless Operations: It can tackle as many operations as you need.
#### 3️⃣ Countless Operands: From two to many operands, it's got you covered.
#### 4️⃣ Infinite Digits: No need to worry about digits – it's ready for any number.

#### 5️⃣ Zero Division Error: It's designed to catch math errors, like dividing by zero.

### This project was crafted using a layered model approach, dividing the functionality into layers - HAL (LCD and Keypad), MCAL (GPIO).
### With static configuration, I developed all drivers (LCD, keypad, GPIO) and created header files from scratch. I'm not done with my diploma yet, but I'm learning and growing every day.
